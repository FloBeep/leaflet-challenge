# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge, we have been tasked with developing a way to visualize United States Geological Survey (USGS)) data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.

#### The Earthquake Visualization

Using Leaflet and a dataset from the USGS, we created a map that plots all the earthquakes that happened last week based on their longitude and latitude.

A popup appears when a marker is clicked and is prodiving the following information:

1. The magnitude of the earthquake by marker size.
2. The depth of the earthquake by marker color.
3. Location of the earthquake.

Earthquakes with higher magnitudes are appearing larger, and earthquakes with greater depth are appearing darker in color.
